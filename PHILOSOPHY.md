# Shoraj Learning Platform - Product Philosophy

## 1. Primary Audience
**Core Audience (Primary)**:
- College students (CS / Data / Math / Stats)
- Early to mid-career professionals in Data Science, Analytics, AI / ML
- Self-learners seeking strong fundamentals ("I know tools, but my fundamentals are weak.")

**NOT For**:
- Quick certificates / Shortcuts
- Purely tool-based tutorials ("Learn X in 7 days")
- Surface-level learners

## 2. Belief About Learning
**Implicit Philosophy**: Real learning happens when reasoning becomes natural.

**Teaching Loop**:
1.  **Concept**: Start from first principles. Explain *why* before *how*.
2.  **Worked Examples**: Step-by-step reasoning. No skipped logic.
3.  **Practice**: Thoughtful problems with increasing difficulty.
4.  **Assessment**: Tests that expose thinking gaps (not memory checks).
5.  **Reflection**: "Why did this work?", "Where did I go wrong?"

## 3. Subject Philosophy
-   **Data Science**: Math-first. Focus on interpretation and assumptions.
-   **Mathematics**: Intuition before formulas. Visual + reasoning-based.
-   **Statistics**: Thinking in distributions. Uncertainty as a concept.
